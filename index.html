            <p>Thank you for being interested in my portfolio, here you will find the projects that I have been 
            working on since I started coding. Please feel free to navigate to the links below, clicking on them will
            take you to the repositories for each one of the projects. I started coding full time recently. 
            Several of the projects come from the <b> MITxPro Full Stack Development</b> program that I started attending in 
            <em>Winter 2022</em>. Several of these projects are still a work in progress, this portfolio and its projects will
            be updated as I gain more experience and proficiency in <em>JavaScript</em>, <em>HTML</em> and <em>CSS</em>, the  
            programming languages on which the <b>MITxPro Full Stack Development</b> program is based.</p>
