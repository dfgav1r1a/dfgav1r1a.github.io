            <p>Thank you for being interested in my portfolio, here you will find the projects that I have been 
            working on since I started coding. Please feel free to navigate to the links below, clicking on them will
            take you to the repositories for each one of the projects. I started coding part time recently. 
            Several of the projects come from the <b> MITxPro Full Stack Development</b> program that I started attending in 
            <em>Winter 2022</em>. Several of these projects are still a work in progress, this portfolio and its projects will
            be updated as I gain more experience and proficiency in <em>JavaScript</em>, <em>HTML</em> and <em>CSS</em>, the  
            programming languages on which the <b>MITxPro Full Stack Development</b> program is based.</p>

      <h3>Bio</h3>
       <p>I am a person that likes to go the extra mile with everything I like to do. Music, Coding/Programming, Currency trading, Woodworking, 
         have been the activities that captivated my attention in the past years. I am a professional musician, went to music school, specialized in classical guitar, earned 
         a few prizes, I have been involved in many music projects and have shared the stage with amazing musicians and performed in renowned stages. Life has been good but decided to
         start learning about coding and programming seriously. I recently enrolled in the <b> MITxPro Full Stack Development</b> program where I have been learning <em>JavaScript</em>, 
         <em>HTML</em> and <em>CSS</em>. Throughout the course I will be refining my skills as a web developer while I dive deeper into the front-end development with the REACT 
        framework and the back-end development using MongoDB, ExpressJS and NodeJS. My goal is to become a proficient developer whose skills can be valuable for your team. Feel free to 
        browse this porfolio, here you will find several <a href="#navbarDropdown">projects</a> that came from the MITxPro Full Stack Development program and some of my own that I hope
        you find interesting and worth of your time. If you are interested in checking my musical side (I have been doing this for 20 years) check out <a href="http://www.danielgaviria.net/artist/daniel-gaviria/" target="'_blank">my website</a>.
