# Daniel Gaviria's Portfolio

### https://dfgav1r1a.github.io/dgportfolio.html

Thank you for being interested in my portfolio, here you will find the projects that I have been working on since I started coding. Several of the projects come from the **MITxPro Full Stack Development** program that I started attending in Winter 2022. I started coding full time recently. These projects are still a work in progress, this portfolio and its projects will be updated as I gain more experience and proficiency in JavaScript, HTML and CSS, the programming languages on which the MITxPro Full Stack Development program is based.

## Description

On this specific repo you will find a table were I list the projects that I am currently developing. At the left column you will find the licensed projects from the **MITxPro Full Stack Development** program which are JavaScript based. At the left column are my own coding projects. Feel free to navigate to any of the links, they will take you directly to the source code of the repos.

## License
The licenses for each of the projects will be described in each repo.
