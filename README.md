# Daniel Gaviria's Portfolio

### https://dfgav1r1a.github.io/

Thank you for being interested in my portfolio, here you will find the projects that I have been working on since I started coding. Several of the projects come from the **MITxPro Full Stack Development** program that I started attending in Winter 2022. I started coding full time recently. These projects are still a work in progress, this portfolio and its projects will be updated as I gain more experience and proficiency in JavaScript, HTML and CSS, the programming languages on which the MITxPro Full Stack Development program is based.

## Description

On this specific repository you will find information about me, my experience as web developer and programmer, a page where I  feature the projects that I am currently developing and my contact information. Within the project dropdown you can access the licensed projects from the **MITxPro Full Stack Development** program which are JavaScript based and, additional projects that I will be developing as I gain more experience and proficiency as a programmer. You will have access to the GitHub repositories that host the source code of each of the projects.

## License
The licenses for each of the projects will be described in each repository.
